# Project: NixOS-Based Event-Driven Autoscaling Platform (Containerless, Cloud-Agnostic, All-in-One)

## 1. Autoscaling Engine and Event Processing

* Real-time metrics ingestion: CPU, memory, I/O, latency, queues.
* Extensible metric sources: Prometheus, Kafka, Redis, RabbitMQ, custom webhooks.
* Predictive scaling using Markov chains or other models (ARIMA, LSTM).
* Threshold-based + predictive hybrid autoscaling strategy.
* Rule engine for user-defined scaling logic.
* Cooldown/anti-thrashing protections.
* Debuggable autoscaling API with history and diagnostics.

---

## 2. Workload Runtime with systemd

* Workloads modeled as systemd units: [app@.service](mailto:app@.service), [web@.service](mailto:web@.service), etc.
* Grouped services act as 'pods'.
* Support for workers, daemons, web services.
* Dynamic unit generation and reloads based on scale.
* Namespace isolation via systemd-run/nspawn (optional).
* Fully declarative configuration using NixOS modules and flakes.

---

## 3. Cloud-Agnostic Infrastructure Provisioning

* Unified provisioning across:

  * AWS Spot Instances
  * GCP Preemptible VMs
  * Hetzner, Proxmox, QEMU, Bare Metal
* Auto-provisioning with NixOps, deploy-rs, or custom tooling.
* Prebuilt closures and Cachix binary cache for fast spin-up.
* Spot lifecycle handling:

  * Interruption detection
  * Rapid migration/replacement
* Role-based flake configurations per machine or service.
* Secure mesh network (WireGuard/Tailscale).
* Task runner
* Build flake just once and publish in somewhere
* Turn your app in flake (ECR like)

---

## 4. Scheduler and Orchestration

* Task distribution across nodes with fault tolerance.
* Distributed event-driven job launcher.
* Retry logic, checkpointing, and job affinity rules.
* Coordination layer with etcd or Consul.

---

## 5. Observability and Telemetry

* Prometheus-compatible metrics exporter on each node.
* Historical metric retention and pattern recognition.
* Time-series DB integration: Prometheus, VictoriaMetrics, InfluxDB.
* Behavior fingerprinting for scaling insights.
* Log aggregation and anomaly detection.

---

## 6. Declarative UI and API Interface

* Web interface for editing configuration.nix and flake inputs.
* Live configuration diff and rollback support.
* Dashboard with system state, scaling activity, and logs.
* Visual or YAML-based rule builder for autoscaling policies.
* Comprehensive audit logs and config history.

---

## 7. Extensibility and Plugin System

* Modular scalers: KafkaScaler, RedisScaler, WebhookScaler.
* Modular providers: AWS, Oracle, Bare Metal, QEMU.
* Runtime abstraction: systemd, systemd-nspawn, firecracker.
* ML plugin support: Markov chains, statistical models, inference engines.
* CLI toolchain similar to kubectl or nomad.

---

## 8. Local Deterministic Pipelines

* Local CI/CD pipeline execution using flakes.
* Reproducible build environments via Nix derivations.
* Full pipeline support:

  * Git checkout
  * Derivation build
  * Config validation (nixos-rebuild dry-run)
  * Integration tests
  * Remote/local deployment
* Sandboxed execution for purity.
* Local agents to monitor and trigger builds.

---

## 9. All-in-One DevOps and SRE Stack

* Integrated CI/CD, observability, and scaling.
* Minimal external dependencies: Nix and Git.
* GitOps-ready monorepo structure.
* Encrypted secrets managed via Nix expressions.
* Supports public cloud, datacenters, edge.

---

## 10. SRE Toolkit

* Node-level dashboards (TUI/web).
* Metrics and logs analyzer.
* Built-in anomaly detection and incident reporting.
* Alert hooks and scaling recommendations.
* Self-healing with health probes and restarts.

---

## 11. Developer Experience

* Unified flake schema for services.
* Templates for new services (nix new-service).
* nix develop environments with all dev tools.
* nix run and nix flake update support.
* Interactive UI/TUI for configuration editing.

---

## 12. Cloud-Agnostic Runtime and Migration

* Rapid rehydration of workloads after spot termination.
* Multi-provider bootable NixOS images.
* Declarative VM configuration in Nix.
* Spot-to-on-demand fallback policy.
* Full cluster simulation locally via QEMU.

---

13. Scaling Strategies Without Containers

This system supports three scaling strategies without relying on containers:

A. Multiple Workloads on Same Machine

Use systemd template units (e.g., myapp@1.service, myapp@2.service).

Each unit runs isolated with different ports or parameters.

Efficient use of multicore machines.

B. Same Workload on Multiple Machines

Deploy same flake config to other machines.

Horizontal scaling through replication across machines.

Often paired with load balancing.

C. Hybrid Strategy

Combine vertical scaling (multiple units per machine) and horizontal scaling (more machines).

Provides fault tolerance, parallelism, and cost efficiency.
